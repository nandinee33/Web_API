# REST API USING NODE.JS
<hr>

### General Introduction:
REST or RESTful stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style as well as an approach for communications purposes that is often used in various web services development. In simpler terms, it is an application program interface (API) that makes use of the HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. we are going to create a Web API with the help of node.js, Express, and Mongoose. Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js.Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB.

### Objective: 
The objective of this project is we will be building a simple StudentDetails application.We will build Rest APIs for creating, listing, editing and deleting student informations.The student web service allows for the retrieval of student and course data.Well! Now that we know what we are going to build, We need a cool name for our application. Let’s call our application StudentDetails API.

### Problem Statement: 
We will build Rest Apis for creating, retrieving, updating & deleting Students.First, we start with an Express web server. Next, we add configuration for Mongodb database, create Student model, write the controller. Then we define routes for handling all CRUD operations and we touch upon authentication and security.Finally, we’re gonna test the Rest Api’s using Postman.
